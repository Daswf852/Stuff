 No clue what I had on my mind while writing these, wont bother organising  
 Actually, I don't think I had anything on mind since it's all over the place  
 It's pretty bad too but I guess it has a decent amount of LoC /shrug
 Oh and, the file `labels` was generated, I'm not insane enough to write that by hand

### Running instructions
 - TODO
